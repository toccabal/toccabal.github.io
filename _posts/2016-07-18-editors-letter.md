TOC Cabal created Silk + Tea as a literary thought-space to give its readers a holistic understanding of the importance of preserving human values under all conditions. To successfully preserve our human values, we need to express an interest in our human interactions throughout our daily living. If we are not able to teach and share our knowledge or skills with everyone around us, we do not have the potential to affect change within our families, our communities, or our societies.

Silk + Tea’s commitment is to bring each other to a state of reverence in our way of thinking so that we can access a humanity that is seated in refinement. The strand of hope that exists in all of humanity is the key to transforming this possibility into our lived reality.

To inaugurate the first edition of Silk + Tea, TOC Cabal has chosen Innovation as the theme. When we limit innovation simply for financial gain, we never reach our full potential. The true value of innovation lies in our ability to share our lived experiences with each other by building bridges where obstacles prevent us from having healthy human interactions. This is the best application of our skills and knowledge in our daily living.

We all have a natural ability to dream, but we have forgotten how. It is not enough for us to remember to dream, we must learn how to dream big. When our dreams are all-inclusive, nobody is left behind. This is how we effect change. This is how we achieve a humanity seated in refinement.

I am the innovator. You are the innovator. We must remember this in all aspects of what we do. Learn how. Learn when. Learn why. Don’t ever get tired of learning the proper way to do things.

Our human values are important. We cannot change this, but we can change our understanding of this. When our human values inform our daily human interaction amidst change, we require innovation of our skills and innovation of our knowledge.
